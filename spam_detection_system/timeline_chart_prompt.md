# Timeline Chart Prompt: Bayesian Spam Detection System Development

## Project Development Timeline Visualization

Create a comprehensive timeline chart showing the development phases of a Bayesian Network-based Spam Detection System from initial concept to deployment, including: **Phase 1 - Research & Planning** (Dataset analysis of SMS Spam Collection v.1 with 5,574 messages, algorithm selection of Multinomial Naive Bayes, technology stack decision for Python Flask + HTML5/CSS3/JS), **Phase 2 - Backend Development** (Flask REST API creation with 5 endpoints, Bayesian classifier implementation using scikit-learn, TF-IDF vectorization setup with 5000 max features, NLTK text preprocessing pipeline with tokenization/stemming/stop-word removal, model training achieving 96.59% accuracy, Joblib serialization for model persistence), **Phase 3 - Frontend Development** (Interactive HTML5 interface design, CSS3 glassmorphism effects implementation, Bayesian network visualization with animated nodes and educational tooltips, real-time confidence meters with progress bars, 3D card animations and scroll-triggered effects, mobile-responsive design optimization), **Phase 4 - Integration & Testing** (CORS-enabled API communication setup, real-time prediction workflow implementation, sample message testing functionality, error handling and validation, cross-browser compatibility testing), **Phase 5 - UI/UX Enhancement** (Advanced animations with cubic-bezier easing, interactive network nodes with hover effects, educational content integration, accessibility improvements, performance optimization), and **Phase 6 - Deployment & Documentation** (System architecture documentation, comprehensive research report generation, user guide creation, final testing and quality assurance), with key milestones including model accuracy achievement, visualization completion, API integration success, mobile optimization, and final deployment readiness, spanning development time estimates and technical achievements at each phase.
