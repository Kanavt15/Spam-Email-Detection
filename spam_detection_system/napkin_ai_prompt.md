# Napkin AI System Architecture Prompt

Create a comprehensive system architecture diagram for a Bayesian Network-based Spam Detection System featuring a Python Flask REST API backend with Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier using TF-IDF vectorization processing SMS Spam Collection dataset (5,574 messages, 96.59% accuracy), connected to an interactive HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript frontend with real-time Bayesian network visualization, animated confidence meters, and educational tooltips, showing data flow from user message input through text preprocessing (NLTK tokenization, stemming, stop-word removal) to feature extraction (TF-IDF with 5000 max features), Bayesian probability calculation (P(spam|words) using naive independence assumption), classification output with confidence scores, and real-time frontend updates including animated progress bars, 3D card transitions, and interactive network nodes representing the probabilistic relationships between message features and spam/ham classification, with model persistence using Joblib serialization, CORS-enabled API endpoints (/predict, /train, /status, /samples, /bayesian-info), and responsive mobile-first design with glassmorphism effects and scroll-triggered animations.
